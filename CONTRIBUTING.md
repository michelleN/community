# Contributing guidelines

This project is for documentation about the community. To contribute to one of
the Kubernetes projects please see the contribution guide for that project.

## How To Contribute

The contributions here follow a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model with some additional process.
The process is as follows:

1. Submit a pull request with the requested change.
2. Another person, other than a Special Interest Group (SIG) owner, can mark it Looks Good To Me (LGTM) upon successful review. Otherwise feedback can be given.
3. A SIG owner can merge someone else's change into their SIG documentation immediate.
4. Someone cannot immediately merge their own change. To merge your own change wait 24 hours during the week or 72 hours over a weekend. This allows others the opportunity to review a change.

_Note, the SIG Owners decide on the layout for their own sub-directory structure._
