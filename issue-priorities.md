These are the meanings of the labels priority/P0 ... priority/P3 that we apply to issues in order to try to prioritize them relative to each other.  We try to apply these priority labels consistently across the entire project, but if you notice an issue that you believe to be misprioritized, please do let us know and we will evaluate your counter-proposal.

- **priority/P0**: Must be actively worked on as someone's top priority right now. Stuff is burning. If it's not being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they're doing immediately to work on it. TL's of teams are responsible for making sure that all P0's in their area are being actively worked on.  Examples include user-visible bugs in core features, broken builds or tests and critical security issues.
- **priority/P1**: Must be staffed and worked on either currently, or very soon, ideally in time for the next release.
- **priority/P2**: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we don't have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. Community contributions would be most welcome in the mean time (although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release).
- **priority/P3**: Probably useful, but not yet enough support to actually get it done. These are mostly place-holders for potentially good ideas, so that they don't get completely forgotten, and can be referenced/deduped every time they come up.
