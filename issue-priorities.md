These are the meanings of the labels priority/p0 ... priority/p3 that we apply to issues in order to try to prioritize them relative to each other.  We try to apply these priority labels consistently across the entire project, but if you notice an issue that you believe to be misprioritized, please do let us know and we will evaluate your counter-proposal.

- **priority/P0**: Must be actively worked on as someone's top priority right now. Stuff is burning. If it's not being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they're doing immediately to work on it. TL's of teams responsible for making sure that all P0's in their area are being actively worked on.
- **priority/P1**: Should be staffed and worked on either currently, or very soon, ideally in time for the next release.
- **priority/P2**: Agreed that this would be good to have, but we possibly don't have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. Hopefully in the future some time we will. Community contributions would be most welcome in the mean time.
-**priority/P3**: Probably useful, but not yet enough support to actually get it done. These are mostly place-holders for potentially good ideas, so that they don't get completely forgotten, and can be referenced/deduped every time they come up.
