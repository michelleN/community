### How do I sign the CNCF CLA?

* To sign up as an individual or as an employee of a signed organization, go to https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf
* To sign up as an organization, go to https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/organization-signup

***

### After you select one of the options above, please follow the instructions below:

**Step 1**: You must sign in with GitHub.

**Step 2**: If you are signing up as an employee, you must use your official person@organization.domain email address in the CNCF account registration page.


**Step 3**: The email you use on your commits (https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/) must match the email address you use when signing up for the CNCF account.

**Step 4**: Once the CLA sent to your email address is signed (or your email address is verified in case your organization has signed the CLA), you should be able to check that you are authorized in any new PR you create.
