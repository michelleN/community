-------

SIG Cluster Ops Mission is to promote operability and interoperability of Kubernetes clusters.  We focus on shared operations practices for Kubernetes clusters with a goal to make kubernetes broadly accessible with a common baseline reference.  We also organize operators as a sounding board and advocacy group.
